3ADC ()
- input filtering with NPO and silvermica type dielectric capacitors, metal film resistors (pg. 12)
- input range from VGA (1.25V)
- 10uF ceramic or tantalum in parallel with .1uF ceramic capacitor for Vref->GND

- board layout
- PCB with ground plane
- separate analog and digital signal lines
- 10uF surface mount AVX capacitor for VDD (Murata GRM219R60J106M)
- 0.1uF ceramic capacitor for VREF
- capacitors located as close to pins as possible (keep traces short and wide as possible)


VGA (AD8331)
- Each channel contains an LNA that provides user-adjustable input impedance termination, a differential X-AMP VGA, and a pro-grammable gain postamp with adjustable output voltage limiting
- hydrophones have a 1kohm impedance at desired frequencies
- HILO, GAIN, VCM (adjust to 1.5V for 3V ADC)
- values of RFM and CSH, based on LNA input impedance
- VCM, RCLMP, driving 3V ADC's
- get rid of some jumpers to save space

- board layout
- multilayer board with power and ground planes recommended
- blank areas in the signal layers filled with ground plane
- decoupling SM caps for power supply pins
- decoupling ferrite beads for LNA power pins
- 5V regulator for VGA array
- LON/LOP traces as short as possible for coupling caps
- Riz placed near LON pin
- resistors placed close to VGA output pins, VOL/VOH
- short signal traces

Voltage Reg
- aluminum electrolytic or tantalum capacitors
- effective series resistance greater than 0.1ohm, less than 5ohm
